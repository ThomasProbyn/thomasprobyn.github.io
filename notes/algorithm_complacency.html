<p>I have been watching Technology Connections now for longer than I can
remember and would recommend <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechnologyConnections/videos">the
channel</a> to anyone even vaguely interested in this site, but <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA">this piece</a> feels
extremely relevant to a lot of what I have been trying to say for a few
years now. The video eloquently explains how we are seemingly losing the
ability to curate our own worlds. I like to think that between projects
such as <a href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/the_slow_line.html">Life
In the Slow Line</a>, <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/justifying_js.html">Justifying
JavaScript: Politeness on the Web</a> and thoughts such as <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/nostalgia.html"><em>Nostalgia, web
design and passion</em></a> I have managed to find some ways in which I
can separate myself from this reality, and regain almost total control
over my own Web experience, and enjoy sharing practical ways in which
you may be able to too. As Alec concludes, this is a personal choice,
and with introspection and self-control can be entirely overcome.</p>
<p><em>P.S.</em> - the video mentions the YouTube subscriptions Feed as
a good way to limit the impact of algorithmic recommendations within
YouTube; I find the RSS feeds YouTube provide for each channel give you
far more control, such as the ability to filter by text (including
completely nuking YouTube Shorts if you wish!) by using the filters
built into any good RSS reader.</p>
