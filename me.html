</header>
<p>I am Tom, a 21-year-old university student based in Edinburgh. I try
to find the greatest joy I possibly can in things which don’t cost
myself, other people, or the planet, and this site acts as a bit of a
shrine to that.</p>

<p>From the categories listed on my <a href="./">home page</a> you can
see my interests.</p>
<p>I am reading User Experience Design (oft abbreviated to UX). Despite
being a course focusing on progressing technology, I have been left with
the distinct (and seemingly rather unique) idea that low technology
solutions are preferable to the modern overcomplicated world in which we
live. I feel we have been blinded by the singular path we have taken,
and that better “realities” would exist had we followed divergent paths,
rather than continually iterating one single path to death. I quite
often run experiments with my own life to test this theory, by trying to
explore technologies which have been left behind and advancing those. I
don’t really go with the flow of the world sometimes, but that’s half
the fun of it!</p>
<p>Please do explore the website, and if you feel compelled, send me a
<a href="./contact">message</a>.</p>
