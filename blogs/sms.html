<p>I found an old screenshot of my phone’s home page from a few years
ago. A few things stood out to me, but chiefly amongst them was the
sheer number of messaging apps that I had. The difficulty was this:
certain people wanted to use certain platforms to communicate. The only
way to communicate on those platforms is to use the specific app that
connects to it. As a result, if you know three people who all use a
different app, you end up with three different apps for essentially the
same thing.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous if you ask me. Messaging apps hold one common
purpose: messaging. Granted, a few of them offered some features which
others did not a few years ago (such as Snapchat’s stories or WhatsApp’s
encryption), but most of these features are now entirely universalised.
This, however, does <em>not</em> mean that the backend systems which
drive these apps are universalised. Were that the case, I would be able
to use WhatsApp to read a SnapChat message, Instagram to read something
from Signal, etc. To users of the Fediverse, this will not seem an alien
concept. I use Mastodon, but someone who prefers Pixelfed or Lemmy can
still open the data I post to my Mastodon account from either of these
platforms. They are completely independent platforms, but using open
protocols they can communicate with each other.</p>
<p>My approach to this problem is not dissimilar, but it is still
slightly different. The universal baseline for messaging, the thing
which almost every mobile phone regardless of operating system or
hardware specification can access is SMS. The Short(/Simple)
Message(ing) Service(/System) (there’s a bit of contention around what
the name <em>actually</em> is) is a way of sending short unencrypted
text messages between devices, and has existed since some of the first
cellular networks were switched on. I find that by doing this, I am able
to use only one piece of software for messaging, rather than having one
specific app for one specific person.</p>
<p>Granted, SMS is limited in terms of its technical capability, but
between it and E-Mail, I think you’d be hard pressed to find something
you can’t do.</p>
