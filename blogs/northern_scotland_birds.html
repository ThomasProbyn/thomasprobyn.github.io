<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">Magnificent birds in Northern
Scotland</h1>
<p class="date">19th July 2024</p>

<p>Please excuse the lack of characteristic witty journalism in the
following article, as I wish to quickly share some images of quite
magnificent birds seen recently on a trip to Northern Scotland.</p>
<figure>

alt="A large photograph of a white-tailed sea eagle. The detail in the brown of its feathers and the yellow of its beak can be quite clearly seen. It is a large, blocky bird with pointy wingtip feathers." />

<p>A white-tailed sea eagle seen in Shieldaig, Torridon. The eagles nest
on an island in the loch, and frequently fly out to feed their
young.</p>

alt="An action style profile shot of an osprey with obvious detail in its markings. A medium-sized dark-colored fish can be seen clutched between its claws." />

<p>Loch Fleet is perhaps best known for its seal population, but an
osprey can be a common sight there too! This one caught a fish then gave
a very impressive display.</p>

<p>The peregrine (also at Loch Fleet) was rather high up but could still
be seen quite clearly. They are known for their speed of flight and this
one certainly didn’t disappoint.</p>
<h3 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h3>
<p>Normal service will resume soon - I am taking a short summer break
from writing blogs but am currently working on one about how read
receipts may cause more stress than certainty in digital communication.
I am now also trialling Mastodon, further details of which may be found
on the <a href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/contact">contact</a> page.</p>
