<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasProbyn/time-signal">GitHub
Project</a></p>
<p>This is a simple personal project which I made so that even when I’ve
got the radio off, I can still hear the Greenwich pips. If you’re
unfamiliar, BBC Radio 4 plays the sound of the Greenwich time signal
every hour. It is an iconic sound of the station. There are 5 short pips
(or beeps), which accurately mark the final 5 seconds of the hour, and a
longer pip which marks the hour itself. It is generated by an atomic
clock in the basement of Broadcasting House and sent out across the
country. There is endless debate about whether it has any use these
days, but I am a fan of it and so I built this little script so I will
always have my own Greenwich pips at home.</p>
<p>The script requires Python and PyGame to be installed (both free
software packages), and can be made to run on something like a Raspberry
Pi (or in my case an old laptop which I use as a NAS). Anything
really.</p>
<h2 id="running-and-configuring">Running and configuring</h2>
<p>In order to run it, simply run the python script, and leave it
going.</p>
<p>As much as I love the pips, I don’t want to be woken up by them, so
there’s an option to turn them on and off at a certain time
automatically. Currently, they turn on at 6AM and off after the pips
which sound at 10PM. In order to adjust this, open the script, and
change the line:</p>
<p><code>datetime.time(6, 0) &lt; current_time &lt; datetime.time(22, 0))</code></p>
<p>to any hours you so choose.</p>
<p>That’s it really. If you’re interested, this is not a recording of
the pips, this is a synthesized version which I made myself. It’s not
perfect or an accurate recreation pitch-wise, but it is
time-accurate.</p>
