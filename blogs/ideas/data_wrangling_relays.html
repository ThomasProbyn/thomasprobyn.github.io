<h1>Problem solving and the transmitter map</h1>
<p><em>20 May 2024</em></p>
<p>I have, for just over a year now, been compiling together various data sources in order to build an extensive map of the UK's transmitter network. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the matter, it is not that the data is non-existent, simply that it is fragmented across many different sources, with no easily findable central database containing every single transmitter, regardless of type or purpose. </p>
<p>Currently, progress is good. The database contains all TV transmitters and associated relays (which can be switched to a legacy mode in order to display only ARQ owned or BBC owned transmitters). The BT Microwave network is also now entirely on there too. This morning's task was to add on self-help relays - a type of very small transmitter site which (generally rural) communities worked together to set up in order to benefit their village or town. The sites were often very simple in nature, using parts which could be bought cheaply (as the community normally had to fund it themselves - only technical expertise was provided by the authorities). A good example of a well-preserved S/H relay is documented <a href="https://tx.mb21.co.uk/gallery/gallerypage.php?txid=1995">here</a> - note the rudimentary construction and consumer-grade components.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Getting the data</h2>
<p>I had not seen any particularly accurate location data for self-help relays thus far - the closest I had found was a <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/38216/selfhelp.pdf">list (pp.20-27)</a> of sites with vague descriptions, in the format of "21 km W Edinburgh". This was nowhere near enough information, and given that there were over 200 of the sites, searching for them using satellite imagery and street-view would be rather out of the question. I kept digging, and for about a year forgot this needed doing. It was this morning when I stumbled, quite by chance upon a <a href="https://tx.mb21.co.uk/gallery/gallerypage.php?txid=1941&amp;showhistoric=1">page</a> on mb21. It stated "Ofcom has released lots of data on Self Helps under a Freedom of Information request" - well golly! I'd better find it then!</p>
<p>Ofcom's <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/foi-dp/foi-responses">FOI database</a> goes back to 2022 at time of writing, well after the time in 2015 in which the MB21 article was published. But through multiple nested archive links, I was able to get back to 2016, before the link to "older responses" disappeared, leaving me empty handed. Time for a bit of precision-googling. I searched for 'ofcom "self help" FOI', in order to try and get a direct match with all documents relating to "self help", and using 'ofcom' to tune out any CBT websites, and 'FOI' to try and limit the number of general information pages which were returned. And indeed, a single document matched all 3 terms!</p>
<p>The informatively named <a href="http://static.ofcom.org.uk/static/foi/FOI%20request%201-248447985.xlsx">Sheet1</a>(Direct Download) would indeed hold the answer: a long list of every single published response to FOI requests between 2013 and 2004. A quick search for "self help" found the relevant option, so I at least had a publication date to look for now. </p>
<p>Going back to the archive site, there was a timeline selector, which I used to select the earliest possible date, and saw a link back to an even older archive! An archive within an archive within an archive! <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20160703021429/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/freedom-of-information/foi-responses/">This</a> proved fruitful, and went all the way back to 2011, early enough to find the 2012 publication of the list of sites I so desperately wanted now. Scrolling down, I found it, and downloaded a <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20160706155535/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/freedom-of-information/foi-responses/2012/june2012/1-212007141/">PDF</a> containing national grid references of every single self-help station. Bingo!</p>
<h2>Part 2: <em>Actually</em> getting the data</h2>
<p>Except, of course that's not the whole story. Because I have been doing this for a while now, I've developed something of a sixth sense with these things, and it was going off like a rocket telling me that any document I had to trace through archived archived archives, using link-orphaned index documents, probably wasn't going to just give me a straightforward copy-and-paste job in order to actually use the data.</p>
<p>PDF is not a raw data format - XLSX is (just about), CSV is the preferred format for data interchange. What I am trying to say is exporting data for use as interchangeable raw data in a PDF would generally not be a good idea, as the formattting of the data is not preserved. Imagine it as sharing an Excel table by taking a screenshot - you can <em>see</em> the data, but it would have to be manually transcribed in order to use it for anything.</p>
<p>There is a common saying amongst programmers - it goes a little like this: Why spend 2 hours manually doing a tedious task when you can spend 2 weeks programming a computer to do it in 0.4 seconds? I quite often take the programming route, but this time I saw sense (and PDF libraries had really scary looking syntax and data structures which might have been more the reason). And to boot, I had uploaded it to a few PDF editors by this point, none of which could actually decompose it in a reasonable way, meaning that any formatting was likely to be entirely aesthetic, and non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_technology">semantic</a> (hardly surprising for an Excel 2007 document put into a PDF, the concept of semanticity would not have been as much of a priority then as it is today). </p>
<p>Indeed, the solution in fact came from a very unlikely source: Apple Preview. Preview now has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> function built in which allowed me to screenshot the PDF document, then pull the text out of it that way with some degree of accuracy. Of course, as the data was serialised, a mistake in one column which resulted in a row being added or removed would mean that every record thereafter would be off by the number of such errors preceding it. 100% accuracy was thus necessary, and at this point, in utter despair, I tried Excel. It turns out, they have an extremely accurate OCR algorithm which could handle the data almost perfectly! I certainly wasn't getting the errors I was from Preview. </p>
<p>Though, I say "almost perfectly" as there were still, naturally, some problems. Excel didn't take well to the fact that some of the data was spaced strangely (thanks PDF!) and started adding numbers in front of grid references etc. I noted that much of the data on the PDF was actually rather useless for my purposes, and so I decided upon a workflow.</p>
<p>I started by screenshotting the PDF data in Preview in order to quantize it into an image. I would then import it into photoshop, and cut out any data which wasn't necessary, leaving me with only the transmitter name and the NGR. I would then upload this to Excel, allow it to format it into table data, and check it manually. Repeat this for some 5 pages, and I <strong>FINALLY</strong> had the data as I needed it.</p>
<h2>Part 3: <strong>Actually</strong> <em>actually</em> getting the data</h2>
<p>Now for the fun part. I exported the data as CSV (as ever it should have been if I may say so) and used my old friend <a href="https://gridreferencefinder.com/">GridReferenceFinder</a> (specifically the <a href="https://gridreferencefinder.com/batchConvert/batchConvert.php">Batch tool</a>) in order to convert the CSV to a Google Earth KML file. Finally, the Self-Help sites are sat in their rightful place alongside my growing database of sites.</p>
<h2>That was a journey and a half</h2>
<p>Getting the data you want isn't always easy, even if it is publicly available. And sometimes you get so tantalisingly close to it but something isn't quite right, and problems still need solving. I think this shows a lot about who we are. Some people would have taken the programmer route here - sitting down methodically and working through the problem. Other people, like me, prefer to bounce about with problems like these, finding lots of different routes and making abstract connections between things. Neither solution is in any way superior to the other, both would arrive at the same result, but knowing how you work - and that doing it your way is okay - is an incredibly powerful feeling.</p>
