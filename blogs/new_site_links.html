<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">A new website (with some broken
links)</h1>
<p class="date">22 May 2024</p>
</header>
<p>I have just finished updating the website (mostly)! I have migrated
to an entirely new custom static site generator which I built in Python
using the Markdown module. This has lots of advantages - firstly it’s
very simple and doesn’t have any of the fluff I don’t need which would
be included if I had just installed a package. Secondly, I know exactly
how it works, so there’s no surprises when it breaks, and I can access
and change the source code at will. And of course, I got to exercise my
programming muscles and do a bit of problem solving, which is always a
positive thing.</p>
<p>However, migrating a website to a whole new system comes with its
challenges. There are still pages which I have not yet updated (and
which will remain legacy for now), and there may be broken links here
and there. If you find a broken link, please kindly <a
href="/contact">send me an E-Mail</a> with a link to the page you found
the broken link on, and which link it was that was broken. I think I’ve
picked most of them up now but there may still be one or two.</p>
<p>I do hope you enjoy using the new site, and that the ease of pushing
an update will now encourage me to write more. Have a browse of the <a
href="/">home page</a> and see any new blogs published!</p>
