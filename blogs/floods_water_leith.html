<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">Great floods in the Water of
Leith</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Updates: New photos after another (drier) walk in
the morning</p>

<p>I do apologise for the brevity of my tone, indeed the lack of
substance in the article which follows, but I have just borne witness to
a most unusual sight, and I hope the photographs included below do go
some way to justifying such a journalistically uncharacteristic short
article.</p>

<p>Edinburgh has today received a rather shocking amount of rainfall -
especially given the season. Naturally, after such a spectacle, one
could expect the resulting surges of the rivers and streams to be
nothing short of spectacular themselves. Indeed, this was my prerogative
for taking the path I did this evening, down to the Water of Leith
walkway at the Modern Art Gallery, thence to Dean village by means of
the path. The Water itself was fascinating, moving at a pace I had seen
rarely, save for the fresh mountain spring, but with a tempestuosity as
yet to be paralleled. Great tonnes of water came barreling down, at a
velocity quite unusual for that section of the Water.</p>

<p>As I made for Dean Village, I was stopped in my tracks by a person
coming the other way. “It’s rather flooded that way”, she warned, though
I decided to try to get as far as I could before turning back. I felt
the upcoming weir must be rather impressive. As it turns out, she was
very much correct - in fact the walkway which sits astride the weir had
indeed become <em>part</em> of the weir! But not even so much as that
mattered - for the path a good hundred feet prior was a good measure
underwater, perhaps beginning at about a foot, going to a good three or
four by the crest of the weir itself.</p>

<p>I decided that perhaps it was the best course to take the steps back
up the steep banks of the valley, and make for Dean Village by the road.
It was certainly less flooded than the walkway - though in places
puddles had formed. I ventured cautiously to the entryway to the Water
of Leith - a few yards downriver from where the flooding had made the
path impassible. It was there that I saw a most unusual sight - the
railings showing the spectacular extent of the flooding. I stood in the
middle of the bridge for a good while, watching the water rush
underneath, youthful as a spring, full as an estuary - a deadly
combination I am certain were one to be unlucky enough to enter.</p>

<p>I was, by this point, entirely sodden through, having foregone my
waterproof coat on account of the temperature. It was something of a
relief indeed - and I was past the point of trying not to get wet, and
indeed just embraced the rain. I concur I must have been quite a sight,
being entirely drenched. I trotted on through Stockbridge, and back up
to Haymarket by way of St. Mary’s Cathedral. The bellringers were at
work and I stopped for ten minutes, alone in the rain to admire the
majesty of the building and their work.</p>
<p>It was thereafter though, back home post-haste for a warm change of
clothes, a towel, and a cup of tea.</p>
