<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">The Telecaster sounds fantastic
unplugged, actually</h1>
<p class="date">4th August 2025</p>
</header>
<p>Yes, yes no blog in three months… [Insert excuse here].</p>
<p>In fairness, I do <em>actually</em> have a bit of an excuse: I’ve
been doing a lot more recording and music stuff recently than I have
been for a few months. And during the course thereof, I have had cause
to record an acoustic guitar. The only problem therewith: I don’t have
one. I do, however, have a lovely <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecaster">Tele</a>. Electric
guitars aren’t generally much use when they are not plugged in to an
amp, or so I thought, but it turns out that foregoing the pickups can
actually give you some pretty interesting results if done with a bit of
forethought and technique.</p>
<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
<p>Speaking of technique, mic selection is something I have begun to
question a little. A bit like guitar selection too - I think people
become attatched to certain ways of doing things, and whilst I agree
that certain tools do certain specific jobs very well, I generally also
take the view that the best mic is the one that you have to hand
currently. I will use an SM57 for quite literally everything, I love the
way it sounds on drums, amps, guitars, piano, and especially my voice.
Maybe that’s just preference or inexperience talking but having handled
significantly more expensive mics in my time, I’ve still not found
anything that sounds quite as good over quite such a wide array of
sources as my 57. It’s not even a real 57! It’s a £10 knockoff! Perhaps
I just got very lucky, but there’s a part of me and my style that’s in
that mic now I think.</p>
<p>Anyway, I placed the 57 about the right distance perpendicular to the
neck pickup on the Tele, angled slightly towards the bridge because
(perhaps purely psychologically) that gave me the impression I’d get the
brighter “bridg-ier” sound that I was looking for. My Tele does sound
nice just listening in the room when unplugged, it has a lovely
chorusing between some of the harmonics, and I hoped that by aiming
there I’d capture some of that.</p>
<p>I should also add that I was recording through a Behringer MDX2100
compressor (again, another one of those lucky finds that was stupidly
cheap second-hand but which seems to make anything I put through it
sound better (except guitar D.I.s. It <strong>sucks</strong> with guitar
D.I.s for some reason)). I pressed record and proceeded to do <em>a
number</em> of takes until I had one with acceptable timing. I ended up
double tracking and panning slightly left and right too.</p>
<p>The recording sounded about how one might expect: Lots of high end,
barely any low end, oodles of attack and basically zero sustain. In
fact, it is these very complaints which I will now use the
aforementioned forethought and technique to solve, becuase I suspect
that this is what puts people off recording electric guitars
acoustically - processing them to sound nice is a bit difficult.</p>
<p>This is the raw sound:</p>

</audio>
<h2 id="transience">Transience</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious thing is the transient-ness of the sound. In
order to deal with that, heavy compression might do the job, although
one of the disadvantages of the 57 knockoff is it can be a little noisey
with the heavier end of the compressor’s reach. Instead, transient
processing might do the job, although when I tried that, it sounded a
little too like limiting, everything suddenly felt hugely dynamic in the
lower volume parts, but anywhere over the threshold sounded limited.
Perhaps it was bias, but I was excited to try <a
href="https://analogobsession.com/">AnalogObsession</a> <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/51962024">FetDrive</a>. This is a
transient processor based on the 1176, known for extremely fast attack,
and which applies saturation to the signal over the threshold, rather
than adjusting it by a factor of the gain over the threshold or simply
limiting it.</p>

experimenting to find the best settings for your recording.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And this turned out to be just the ticket. With a surpisingly small
bit of tweaking, this signal no longer sounded harsh, but almost
compacted and more solid. It wasn’t like an instrument being thwacked,
it was like an instrument being played, and what’s more, the lack of a
distracting transient really drew attention to the chorusy sound of the
tele’s harmonics. This is easily the most important plugin in the chain,
everything after this point makes it sound better, but without this
processor, the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>Next up in the chain is an <a
href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/">IK</a> <a
href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trcomprexxor/">Comprexxor</a>.
It’s not actually doing any compression (though I think it was at one
point), it’s actually just adding gain and a little more saturation
using the tone section. It does slightly thicken the sound up when you
isolate the gain stage and A/B it, but it’s not the most important
plugin in the chain by far, just a little tasteful saturation.</p>

<h2 id="frequency-response">Frequency Response</h2>
<p>The next biggest problem after the transience of the signal (which is
all but solved now) is the frequency response. It’s all high end and no
body. This would not be a problem if this was a layered element, and in
fact I’ve left it at just the above processing on other songs where I’ve
used this trick to create the “phantom acoustic” (where you’ve got an
acoustic playing the same part as an amped electric to give the whole
part a little more shine). But this is a lead acoustic part playing big
open chords, and I want them to resonate and fill the whole mix up.</p>
<p>The EQP-1 is a tool that is mostly known as a bit of a one-trick
pony. It does <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pultec_EQP-1#In_use">that cool bass
thing</a>, but I’ve never really seen anyone use it for much else
particularly. The Pultec actually has a whole high-end section which can
do similarly cool things to the low-end section. Because (as I
understand it at least) the original hardware (and thus the software
clones simulate this) had two different signal paths, one for
attenuation, one for boosting, the two different signals would be mixed
together and sound… interesting. I should really research the technical
side of what’s going on there, it’s probably something to do with phase
differences and transient-dependant circuit components reacting
differently to the differently processed programme material (which does
sound the exact sort of thing I’m intrerested in), but suffice it to
say, the settings I used on the guitar sound good.</p>
<p>The high end attenuation felt like it took away something a little
lower in the frequency domain than the high end boost added back,
meaning the piece got more sparkly, but the harsher sounding sibilance
was gone. This is a techniue I’d applied to vocals before too. I also
boosted the low end and did not attenuate it at all. This added in a bit
of body to the sound which was otherwise missing, and compensated for
the lack of a resonating hollow body in the guitar. One of the important
things I set on the EQ was opening up the bandwidth to its widest
setting so that the filters would be very gentle in their response, and
could influence a wide area of the spectrum.</p>

The high end is boosted by 3.4 out of 10 and attenuated by 6.9 out of 10, and the frequency is 12Khz. The attenuation switch is in the middle position, 10dB. Bandwidth is at 10 out of 10" />

<h2 id="reverb">Reverb</h2>
<p>I finished off the chain with a bit of reverb. This added back the
sustain which an acoustic might otherwise have had. I used <a
href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trfarmstoneroom/">The Farm
Stone Room</a> which is a fantastic sounding room reverb based on the
Phil Collins drum room apparently. I used it to add a bit more of a
stereo image, and accentuate some harmonics too, and as it has the
compression in the famous gated reverb console, it is doing some light
dynamics processing too, as well as a little EQing. This plugin was more
of a stylisation for the particular mix I wanted to add the element
into, rather than something to make it sound more like an acoustic,
although it sort of does double duty as I would recommend some sort of a
room reverb for this kind of thing.</p>

A curtain used to dampen the sound by covering the wall is not in use." />

<p>This is the final element, isolated.</p>
<audio controls>
<source src="../assets/dfm_guitar_processed.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<p>I think this sounds fantastic, perhaps it’s not 100% identical to an
acoustic, but in the context of the mix I think it leads the entire song
despite managing to not intefere with the vocal. Have a listen to the
final mix of the song (which isn’t getting released I don’t think), and
see what you think. Excuse Logic’s janky technique for cutting off the
end of files - do you really think I can be bothered to trim it
properly?!</p>

<p>I’ve got some other songs I’m really happy with at the moment so will
hopefully release them very soon!</p>
