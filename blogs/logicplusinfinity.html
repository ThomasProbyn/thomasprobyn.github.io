<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">+∞, Logic Pro and digital audio</h1>
<p class="date">24 September 2025</p>
</header>
<p><em>N.B. This article is pure postulation based on previous
experience and limited programming knowledge</em></p>
<p>There’s been various discussions on Logic Pro forums recently which
usually take a similar form to this. Somebody will post a photograph of
their master fader with the readout at the top stating some ridiculous
decibel number - possibly even +∞ dB, with the caption “That hurt”, or
something similar. A number of people who have never seen this sort of
relatively common thing before will reply in shock, some will reply with
“this solution worked for me!”, but never once have I seen anybody
explain what it is that is going on here, and why it is nowhere near as
scary as it looks.</p>
<p>My Computer-Sciencey postulation would be dodgy buffer logic,
probably an overflow in one of Logic’s stock plugins, given that I’ve
not seen this in other DAWs recently (though I did once experience it
with an FL Studio stock plugin; I suspect a similar sort of thing was at
fault). But what does any of that even mean?</p>
<h2 id="an-analogy">An analogy</h2>
<p>Warning: this is a pretty technical article. Imagine it like this: If
you watch a video of the sun, do the billions of gigawatts of energy it
produces get spewed out of your screen and engulf your house in flames?
Of course not! Your screen can only produce a set level of brightness,
and after that, it will simply clip (which is called “overexposure” in
video/photo terms). We know that if you put the highest brightness value
you can (#ffffff) into a screen, you get white. You are doing exactly
the same with your audio interface!</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-guide-to-digital-audio">A quick guide to digital
audio</h2>
<p>You’ve heard of audio being 16-bit or 24-bit, possibly even 32 or 64
bit floating point. When your DAW records or processes audio, it places
a sample point at a fixed position in the time domain, equivilent to
once every 1/samplerate seconds. These sample points represent the
amplitude of the wave at that point. However, given that the analogue
value coming in from your mic or guitar or what-have-you is an
indiscrete value (a bit like height rather than a discrete value like
shoe size), and your computer cannot store an indiscrete value, it must
be quantised.</p>
<p>The accuracy of that quantisation defines how much data, and thus
storage space and bandwidth, is needed. 16-bit, which is a perfectly
acceptable resolution in most cases, has 2^16 individual “voltage
levels” it can represent amplitude with, 65535 levels in real terms. At
that point, the human ear cannot distinguish between level 65535 and
65536. These levels are so similar that our ears write them off as
basically the same thing, meaning that you don’t hear any sort of
distortion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But, when you hit “voltage level” 65536, you can’t go to 65537. That
simply won’t work, it’s a hard ceiling. In binary terms, you’ve set all
of your 16 available bits to 1: <code>11111111 11111111</code><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. You can’t just add another bit, or
you’d be in 17-bit, and things just don’t work like that! What really
happens is one of two things. Most DAWs will “hard clip” - no matter how
much more sound you give them, they will never go above the value of
65536, and will just flatten any waveform above that value (digital
clipping). If you are using a “dumb” system, your programme will pretend
there is a 17th bit, and thus set the value to 65537:
<code>00000000 00000000 1</code><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. But given that this
17th bit doesn’t exist in your hardware, it gets
deleted:<code>00000000 00000000</code>, and the number you end up with
is a big fat zero.</p>
<p>And as a result of that, you’ve just created a discontinuity. By
jumping from the highest possible voltage value to the lowest possible,
what you’ve created is the same thing as when you forget to crossfade
between two audio clips: a click. This is called a buffer overflow -
because you tried to put more data into the buffer than it is capable of
holding.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-logic-trying-to-deafen-me">Why is Logic trying to deafen
me?</h2>
<p>Sometimes in audio, it can be useful to treat the sample value as 1-x
rather than x. This means working from Full Scale down, rather than -∞
up. In practical terms, this means inverting the buffer. If you invert
the buffer after overflowing it, you will end up with all 1s. This is
one possible way of a multitude that could result in the output value
being all 1s.</p>
<p>However, the signal this would output would be DC (0Hz). People
describe loud distorted sounds. I’d suggest that this could possibly be
a bitrate mismatch in a plugin - if a plugin is storing 32-bit values in
a 24 bit buffer, this will have the effect of amplifying and digitally
clipping that sound quite significantly. On reflection, this is probably
the most likely explaination for what is happening here, but I can’t be
sure.</p>
<h2 id="db-really">+∞ dB, really???</h2>
<p>No, not at all. Such things do not exist. Logic uses 64-bit float
internally, which has stupidly ridiculous headroom. But the metering is
relative to the output format you use (because the format describes the
headroom, and thus Full Scale), so when Logic tries to fit a 64 bit
signal which is very loud because of a bitrate mismatch into, say a 16
or 24 bit output format, it just ends up clipping. Given this, Logic
just gives the value +∞ dB to say there is a lot of stuff above this
that’s getting clipped off.</p>
<p>Even the screenshots I’ve seen with +200dB aren’t really at +200dB.
Fine, maybe that is true internally, but as soon as logic puts that
value down the wire to your audio interface, it will only produce the
loudest sound it can produce. It could not physically ever produce
anything over about 110dB through the normal headphones these people
seem to be using, and even if you are running your headphones through a
5000 watt PA amplifier, they’d have burned out long before you reach
anywhere near +200dB.</p>
<p>+200dB means 200 decibels above the point at which the audio began
clipping (Full Scale - hence dB relative to FS - dbfs). In order to
demonstrate this, get any sound in Logic, and add a bunch of gain
plugins, each adding 24dB of gain. Enable them one-by-one with your
interface/amp volume set extremely low. Notice how at some point, even
though the number gets progressively higher in Logic, the sound stops
getting louder, and only harmonics are added. Don’t try turning up your
monitor volume, you may burn out the voice coils in your speakers!</p>
<p>Effectively what we are doing here is causing a bitrate mismatch. We
are putting too many bits into our 16/24 bit buffer, and they are
getting clipped off, creating a loud waveform. But Logic, with its 64
bits, can still see all of the clipped off stuff, and thus measure
where, if we had 64-bit headroom, the peak level would be.</p>
<p>But never will that reach your ears or your speakers.</p>
<p>Equally never will these high digital values damage the digital
processors (this is a question I saw somebody ask). A digital processor
knows no difference between 0 and its highest possible buffer value,
there is no difference<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in voltage between these two.</p>
<h2 id="practical-tips">Practical Tips</h2>
<p>A lot of people suggest putting a limiter on the master. I don’t. For
all I know, Limiter may be the plugin with the mismatch problem! But
more fundamentally, a limiter is not going to react quick enough. It is
not designed to operate on the individual buffers of audio, but in a
more musical way, across macrodynamics within the audio. Limiters will
almost always introduce latency and could cause mixing issues for people
who are not experienced in mixing into a nonlinear mixbus. Having said
that, I love mixing into a hard limiter and almost always do it;
irreverence is fun!</p>
<p>REAPER has the solution, as is so often the case. In the settings is
an option which will mute the mixbus instantly if any peak above a
certain level is detected. I’ve got it set to the default of +18dbfs,
which has always seemed sensible to me. Loud enough that I can do silly
things with audio and overpower my limiter if I really want to, quiet
enough that if a mismatch occurs, I won’t damage my speakers or
ears.</p>
<p>This works instantly, and on the buffer, meaning that an errant
buffer will never reach your speakers. Every DAW should have this, but
I’m sure doing this as a plugin would be extremely easy. In the
meantime, keep your volume low. The final limiter your audio goes
through is the knob on your audio interface or amp - YOU control the
maximum voltage level of the output, Logic merely requests it.</p>
<p>I hope this article has helped you understand what is going on with
your audio, and why things like +200dB or +∞dB cannot exist, that your
audio output level is limited by the maximum possible voltage value your
amp can produce.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>To the nerdier amongst you, that is not to say that the
distortion is not there - quantisation of an indiscrete value will
<em>always</em> cause distortion, but in this case, the distortion is
reduced to the point of being inaudible. Quantisation distortion of
amplitude sounds cool though - and we have a name for it -
bitcrushing!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
