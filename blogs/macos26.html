already</h1>

<p>What’s it been? Less than 24 hours definitely! Apple’s new operating
system versions have always been pretty good for me, especially being in
the audio world, where everybody knows that you never upgrade a Mac for
at least 3 months after an OS release lest Pro Tools spontaneously
combusts - or something like that. I was pretty early on xOS 26 in that
sense (I’m calling it xOS because it’s sort of unified now, everything
is 26 rather than different versions of everything).</p>
<p>Anyway, I hate liquid glass. That’s the main thing. And I don’t hate
the way it looks - much at least. It’s fine, not my personal choice of
aesthetic direction - as you can probably tell from the design of this
site - but nontheless, it’s pretty graphically inoffensive. Graphically
though - I hate it as a concept ultimately. There’s been a few articles
I’ve read on the matter, but the general logical concencus is that it
must be more computationally heavy than - for instance - blurring. For
blur, the simplest kind at least, you effectively run a space-domain
lowpass filter over the pixels, allowing their vales to be influenced by
their neighbours multiplied by a fractional factor proportional to the
distance of the neighbouring pixel. More complex algorithms exist, but
blur is relatively simple to compute.</p>
<p>Glass effects, on the other hand, are not. It’s impossible to say
without seeing the source code, but I assume Apple is probably using
some sort of ray-tracing system, I certainly haven’t managed to come up
with any way this sort of thing would be possible using traditional
mathematical tranformations. Having said that, my programming background
is web technologies and a bit of audio DSP, so I’d have no idea how to
do this sort of thing anyway. The point is though that ultimately, this
<em>must</em> be using more resources than the simple blur effect which
MacOS had in previous versions was using. I suspect this based on
semi-empirical evidence even! That is - when I turn on liquid glass on
xOS 26, my battery acts like a lead balloon. When I turn it off, it’s
pretty much back to how it was, if not a little better even!</p>
<p>As a trained UX designer, everything is screaming at me to be excited
about this new more natural direction of UI design, but I’m not. I’m
disapointed in it. Granted, I am not a typical UX designer, especially
given that I <em>still</em> think the terminal is the best UI available,
but ultimately, I don’t see how a feature which uses more battery for
almost no real benefit helps me.</p>
<p>I’d personally prefer it if my computer got out my way and had as
little impact in my life as possible. That was part of the reason I
bought a Mac in the first place, I was sick to death of nursing Windows,
and hadn’t quite transitioned my workflows over to something that could
support Linux at that point. Macs seemed to shut up and just let me
work, and for the most part, it has done that fantastically.</p>
<p>But now, it feels like it’s trying to grab too much of my attention
with shiny visual things, and in so doing, it’s eating into the
computational resources I bought for doing <em>my</em> things with. For
now, I’ve disabled liquid glass, and it’s all gone back to perfectly
visually (and computationally) acceptable blurs now, and my machine
feels a lot less laggy than it did!</p>
<p><strong>I MOVED TO LINUX</strong> blog when? Not for a while. It’d be
quite ironic to complain about disliking liquid glass for its energy
impact and then say I’m throwing away a perfectly good laptop. But when
this laptop does eventually die, take it as a warning sign that I have
recently moved over to an OS-agnostic file storage system, and that I am
trying to move towards using REAPER (which runs on Linux) as my main
DAW, rather than Logic. There may be another chapter to this story.</p>
