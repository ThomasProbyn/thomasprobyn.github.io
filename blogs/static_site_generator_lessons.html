<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">Why I built a static site
generator</h1>
<p class="date">23rd November 2024</p>
</header>
<p>“Don’t re-invent the wheel” has its place. The problem is when you
over-generalise the sentiment - you end up ignoring the problems simply
because solving them is, itself, a bigger problem.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I finally gave up with the system I had used to generate
this site previously. I was using a Python script which I had written to
effectively take the human-readable MarkDown files I had written and
batch convert them over to a machine-readable HTML format for posting on
the web. This is, <em>strictly</em> speaking, a static site generator.
It generates a series of HTML web-pages which your browser can process,
which don’t require a server at all (apart from to actually transfer the
files across the web). However, for things like the list of latest blogs
on the home page, I had to manually write those by hand, which quite
often resulted in mistakes and broken links on the site. There was a lot
to remember to do before I could publish a blog. My process looked like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a blog you’re happy with</li>
<li>Add in things like the nav bar and title using MarkDown</li>
<li>Use the Python script to convert the files over to HTML</li>
<li>Edit the home page to have a link to the new blog</li>
<li>Edit the category page to have a link to the blog</li>
<li>Manually add a new item to the RSS feed so that people who subscribe
get a ping</li>
<li>Push to GitHub for the automatic build and deployment process to be
handled</li>
<li>After a minute or two, the update is visible</li>
</ul>
<p>There were so, so many problems with this system. Foremost, there
were so many manually edited files where things kept going wrong. I have
found broken links on the site which have sat there undetected for
months, which is the sort of thing that keeps me up at night! Secondly,
I am a very big fan of semantic separation. When I write a blog in
MarkDown, I shouldn’t have to handle things like the navbar etc: that
should be handled during the compilation process. Also, I wasn’t happy
with the organisation system. My old site had 4 main categories of
blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walks and outdoors</li>
<li>Thoughts and ideas</li>
<li>Projects</li>
<li>Art and music</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was picking those categories, I tried to find 4 which
reflected me, and the idea always was that I could add more if the need
ever arose. But I didn’t want to add a whole new category for just one
blog - that wouldn’t feel right. I ended up stuffing most things into
“thoughts and ideas” as a catch-all category, that also didn’t feel
quite right either. I had seen a lot of sites on the indie web using
tags as an architecture for organising posts.</p>
<p>In a tags architecture, posts exist as an independent, disorganised
entity. There is a folder which contains every single post, regardless
of date, time, topic, length etc. Each post has thematic tags attached
to it, and during the build process, the compiler reads these tags, and
builds a new page for each one. Every post tagged with the specific tag
(say for example posts tagged as “walks”) will be linked from this page.
That means that anyone who wants to read about all of my walks needs to
go onto the tags page, find the “walks” tag, and click through all the
blogs on there.</p>
<p>Tags have another major advantage over my old hierarchical system
too: one post can be given multiple tags. If I had, in the past, written
a post which fell both into the categories of “walks” and “ideas”, I’d
have had to choose which of those categories to file it under. This is
why I kept filing things under “thoughts and ideas”, as I specifically
kept it as a rather ambiguous category; what <em>is</em> a blog if not a
collection of thoughts and ideas, after all?</p>
<h2 id="the-wheel">The wheel</h2>
<p>Re-inventing the wheel, then. If what I wanted was a dynamically
generated home page and a tags architecture, then I could have used
plenty of pieces of open-source software to do that for me.</p>
<p>One of the points I am very much trying to hammer in through my
Honours dissertation is that not all software is suitable in all
scenarios. I’m focusing on digital Integrated Library Systems (ILS) for
home use there, and my own experience over the summer of trying to find
a piece of software which would allow me to tag my books without having
to set up complex systems which would benefit a large lending library
but which are to me, a royal pain.</p>
<p>Indeed, this seems to hold true of static site generators too. What I
wanted was something that could: - Batch convert my MarkDown to HTML -
Build a dynamic home page etc. - Build a tags architecture - Build the
relevant RSS feeds</p>
<p>All I found I could get was something that would do that, but
overcomplicated the process and included things like HTTP servers,
preview environments, templates, databases, etc. It was too much. I
understand that there are people in the world who really benefit from
being able to shave a few seconds off their site’s build time, but I am
not one of them. I am more than happy to hit build and wait for a few
minutes whilst my site does its thing.</p>
<p>All I needed really was something that could quickly feed the
relevant files into Pandoc for conversion, and then build a few
“pseudo-markdown” files with the dynamic contents, and feed those into
Pandoc too.</p>
<p>I started out by defining my design goals for this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write in MarkDown, convert to HTML</li>
<li>MarkDown supports inline HTML</li>
<li>Auto-generate RSS/ATOM feed based on YAML headers</li>
<li>/latest redirects to latest blog automatically</li>
<li>POSSE syndication of notes</li>
<li>Pandoc based build process</li>
<li>Tag-based organisation system</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these are implemented, some of them (like /latest and POSSE)
I still need to do at some point soon.</p>
<p>I drew this little data-flow chart explaining my build chain, and
then went and wrote that in Python and a bit of Bash.</p>

</figure>
<p>And really, this is why I built a static site generator. Not because
I could do it better (in fact it currently takes 1 minute 30 seconds to
build this site - I think I might have got a loop wrong somewhere), but
because I could do it better <strong>for me</strong>. When I was 400
lines of Python deep, silently lamenting at at Pandoc for not doing what
I was expecting (my fault, naturally, I’d messed something up; pandoc is
amazing), the available options did look appealing. But I am very glad I
persisted, because I was able to sit down and think about what I needed,
then build it all in a day.</p>
<p>The problems we work on these days are far more complex than wheels.
We have far more moving parts and systems, and sometimes it can take
burning them all down and starting right from scratch with the scars and
pains which the last system gave you to actually make progress.</p>
<p>Those who know me personally are absolutely sick to death of hearing
my catchphrase, “Progression is not always progress”. It means making a
change for the sake of making a change is not the way to progress
something - it reflects the lack of forethought I see in a lot of
decision making. I’d like to propose a spin-off: “Progress is rarely
progression”. This phrase means something distinctly different;
continuing with the status quo might keep us moving in what feels like
the right direction, but that’s no good if what we really need to do is
stop and go back to the beginning of the problem.</p>
