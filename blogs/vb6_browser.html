<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">VB6 is back! How I learned to
code</h1>
<p class="date">20th November 2024</p>
</header>
<p>This is exciting! I was about 4 or 5 when I sat down at a computer
and first opened Visual Basic 6 I think (not that I can really remember
that now!). This morning, <a
href="https://bandysc.github.io/AvaloniaVisualBasic6/">this link</a>
popped up in my RSS feeds (from <a
href="https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/">Tom Scott’s newsletter</a>,
specifically). I wasn’t sure what it’d be like, but my goodness, it’s so
weirdly nostalgic.</p>
<p>The icons! The structure of it! <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-the-multiple-document-interface">MDI</a>!!!
There is so much that I haven’t seen in 15 years at this point, and yet
I immediately started remembering some of the things I used to build in
VB. I could even remember some of the syntax! This was a time before I
knew how to even use the internet really, and besides what internet
existed was very slow and meant that people couldn’t take phone calls. I
had a book, an enormously weighty tome to be precise, on practically
everything you could do in VB6. I didn’t understand even a tenth of the
things in that book, I just saw the cool projects, and figured out how
to build them by connecting the example code snippets together. Seeing
this interface reminded me of the feeling I quite often get when
programming nowadays: I really <em>want</em> to make something, but I
don’t know how, so I keep playing around until I get there.</p>
<p>I hope someone out there still has all the fun I do with programming
and just making things for the heck of it, because with all the no-code
solutions and AI nonsense, it feels like we’re losing an artform and
fast.</p>
