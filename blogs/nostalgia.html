<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">Nostalgia, web design and
passion</h1>
<p class="date">13th Jan 2024</p>
</header>
<p>Since turning 20 last year, I have started experiencing an emotion
which I was previously oblivious to. I do believe that the name for this
emotion is “nostalgia”, and it must be one of the strongest emotions I
have ever felt. This very website, in fact, is partially a result of
that feeling, as I have recently been using the <a
href="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> to
browse archived copies of the internet as-was. I felt much affinity for
the hand-crafted nature of these sites, undoubtedly influencing the
design of my own. This site exists as, in my view, the natural
continuation of what those websites may have been like were they created
with modern standards. As it happens though, I am rather unsure as to my
reasoning for feeling so nostalgic about such websites, given that I
simply was not around to experience their existence.</p>
<p>I used to believe in the absolute rule of websites being (what we
would today refer to as) “content-driven”. In old money, this is
function-over-form; the idea that the text of a website and the
information it carries outweighs any need for any fancy graphics which
may live alongside (or, depending on your perspective, impede) it. In
practice, this website used to look rather more “shabby”, though that
was simply because there was absolutely no formatting. Information was
the currency, and it was up to your browser’s default settings to
interpret the page. Now, however, I feel I have rather a more well
rounded view on the matter.</p>
<p>Of the admirations I had for the numerous pages I visited on the
archive, the general feeling I was left with was one of gratitude. One
could tell instantly that, although often created by complete amateurs,
these websites were nearly always built for nothing more than passion.
This was a time when it simply was not <em>possible</em> to earn money
from producing web ‘content’ for the most part, and in fact was more
likely to <em>cost</em> one money to host. Perhaps that is what I feel
nostalgic for? The carefree passion I once felt to my childhood
electronics projects and sloppily coded VB scripts. And that passion is
perhaps what I aim to continue here.</p>
