<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">An afternoon poke about
Restalrig</h1>
<p class="date">23rd April 2025</p>
</header>
<p>Being well over halfway through my honours dissertation, I decided to
chance an afternoon off. This morning, having flicked through Fawcett’s
fabulous <a
href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/11979201?oclcNum=11979201">Scottish
Medieval Churches</a> I was quite taken aback to see listed on the map
on the rear cover Restalrig.</p>
<p>The area was one I had not explored. Shamefully, I had all but
written it off, having seen it from a distance from the bus window and
thought not much of it. Admittedly, the London Road does not provide a
particularly pleasing aspect over what is a quaint and ancient village,
home to an extremely old collegiate church with enough history and
legend to please all but the most churlish enthusiasts of ecclesiastical
architecture.</p>
<p>I should preface my visit by saying that all of my knowledge here
comes from a single source, the ever-erudite Malcolm Cant, whose
<em>Villages of Edinburgh</em> series has proved an indespensible
companion to my wanders about the city. Restalrig is accounted in <a
href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/979256186">volume one</a>, and I
shall try to add more of my experience here than simply recounting Cant,
something which I do hope he would be agreeable to, as I am sure it was
his desire to improve the knowledge of the residents of Edinburgh about
their city.</p>
<p>I alighted the no. 34 bus at Marrionville Drive, and made the short
walk back up to St. Ninian and Triduana RC church, having mistaken its
high walls for those of the much older church for which I was looking.
Immediately, it was clear that though it had older parts, this was not
the church in question. I turned back the way I had come, sensing a more
“town centre” feeling to the other end of the street.</p>
<p>It was here that I happened across Restalrig Road South, and saw what
looked like the ancient walls of an old monastary<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Intrigued, I proceeded.</p>

<p>Blanchland was the first thing that came to mind, a village vaguely
within Northumberland, to the south of Hexham. There, the old monastic
walls form parts of the modern-day village, and that was much the case
in Restalrig. The street was very quiet - a one-way affair - and had a
decidedly different feeling to it than the rest of the area. I knew that
at the end of this street was the church, and it was to this that I
first ventured.</p>

<p>Restalrig church (dedicated to St Margaret) holds as much
ecclesiastical importance as it does architectural. Ecclesiastically,
the area was once home to a spring with healing powers, found around the
6th century by St. Triduana. She supposedly came to Angus to live the
life of a recluse but was persued romantically by Nectan, King of the
Picts. He became obsessed by her eyes, and finding this to be obtrusive
to her religious endeavours, plucked them out on a thorn and handed them
to the King’s guards. Triduana ended up at Restalrig, where she found
the waters had healing powers over the eyes. Restalrig well, now
dedicated to the saint, became a place of pilgramage for those afflicted
by blindness and similar conditions of vision. (N.B., this is an
<em>extremely</em> poor retelling of the story accounted in Cant
(1982)).</p>
<p>Over the well was built a grand hexagonal structure sometime around
1440-1470 (Baldwin, 1985), only the undercroft of which survived. This
is thanks to a disagreement on the topic of sexual morality between
Logan of Restalrig and the new Protestant church. Restalrig church was
declared by the General Assembley a “Monument of Idolatrie” and they
ordered it be “utterlie castin downe and destroyed”. And indeed it was,
with very little of the 14th century building remaining, specifically
only some parts of the north, south and west gables of the choir, with
most of the stone being used to build parts of the old town.</p>
<p>The hexagonal building was restored by Thomas Ross in 1906, though
only to a single storey despite there being evidence for two originally.
Cant’s description of the buildings is, as ever, extensive and detailed,
and I would thoroughly recommend his account as further reading.</p>
<p>I progressed out of the churchyard and continued reading as I walked,
stopping to sit on a bench in the street opposite the buildings about
which I was reading. In front of me was the oldest building in
Restalrig, and indeed between its extremely weathered-looking stone and
stout doorway, this was a fact I could believe. Cant remarks that this
building was once used as the church hall, but before that had likely
been domestic. The crowsteps on the gables were later additions, and
indeed the building has been heavily altered from its original form,
with the windows being replaced by doorways on the lower floor and the
removal of an extrnal staircase, the landing of which was said to have
been made of one of the headstones from the churchyard opposite.</p>

House</a>, now a community centre, stands in all its Baronial splendour.
Cant, and indeed the above linked blog both go into detail about the
eccentric residents and architectural changes which have given the house
its coloured history.</p>
<p>Having an afternoon poke about a place which one had previously
written off and finding a medieval enclave is perhaps one of my
favourite hobbies. It’s something I seem to manage to do with alarming
regularity, which I suppose could speak to the fact that I should be
more thorough before writing anywhere off! As always, my collection of
books on historical, especially ecclesiastical, architecture proved
invaluable in understanding the meaning and history of certain buildings
- reading them rather than simply seeing them if you will. I look
forward to the next village I happen to discover…</p>
