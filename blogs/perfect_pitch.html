<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">The ambiguous world of perfect
pitch</h1>
<p class="date">11th August 2024</p>
</header>
<p>Three years ago, I discovered I had an ability known commonly as
“perfect pitch”. During that discovery process though, I took many tests
which I seemed to keep failing - at times even managing to convince
myself I didn’t have it. Different but similar words being thrown about
online confused matters even further, so this blog forms “the guide I
wish I had had” of sorts.</p>
<h2 id="terms-and-definitions">Terms and definitions</h2>
<p>There are many different terms used to describe slightly differing
abilities on the topic of pitch comprehension. They often get confused
for one another, and so described briefly these are:</p>
<h3 id="pitch-memory">Pitch Memory</h3>
<p>The innate ability to hear a frequency and correctly remember it over
a period of time. Most people’s pitch memory lasts a few minutes to
maybe an hour, meaning if you play them a note and ask them to sing it
again after a few minutes, they’d sing something flatter or sharper than
what you played. In people with the ability to develop <strong>perfect
<em>or</em> absolute</strong> pitch, pitch memory is either infinite or
lasts long enough to be considered effectively infinite. There is not
enough research into pitch memory to be sure, but the best consensus we
have currently is that the duration of your pitch memory is something
you are born with and no matter how much you practice, it cannot be
changed in any meaningful way.</p>
<h3 id="perfect-or-absolute-pitch">Perfect <em>or</em> Absolute
pitch</h3>
<p>“Perfect” is a colloquial word, “absolute” is the scientific word -
but the two are used interchangeably and mean exactly the same thing.
This is an ability which people who have long or infinite pitch memories
can develop by committing to memory the 12 notes in the octave, as well
as their names. This gives them a “note dictionary”, meaning they can
hear a frequency in the real world, find the one that matches it in
their head, and then label that real-world frequency with a note name.
In practice, this is the ability which is most famous - the ability to
hear a telephone bell for instance and instantly describe it as “that’s
an E-Flat”.</p>
<h3 id="relative-pitch">Relative Pitch</h3>
<p>This is the ability trained musicians have to understand how two
different notes relate to each other. In it’s simplest form, this is how
anybody sings along to songs they like. It is how you can listen to a
song you have heard before, then pause it and keep singing along -
because you understand that the next note relative to the one you last
heard should be higher or lower. A trained musician can use this ability
to play a C on a piano, then be able to sing a G. As far as we know,
genetics have little baring on your relative pitch abilities and almost
everyone can learn it with a bit of practice. It is something most
people pick up when studying music at school or learning how to play an
instrument.</p>
<h3 id="notepitch-dictionary">Note/pitch dictionary</h3>
<p>This is a term which I came up with for the purposes of this article
- you won’t find it used elsewhere. This is the best way I can explain
how people with perfect pitch can take a sound and map its frequency to
a note name. For most people with perfect pitch this becomes instant and
effortless, just like how you start by learning a new language from a
dictionary but it soon just becomes second nature.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-ingredients-to-perfect-pitch">The two ingredients to
perfect pitch</h2>
<p>Most people who have a long or infinite pitch memory (and who know
about it) are classically trained musicians. I am not - I had a few
music lessons but I always enjoyed playing more than learning. I still,
to this day, cannot read sheet music, but I do enjoy producing music and
playing recorder (and various other folk-woodwind instruments) as well
as piano. As a result of this slightly sacrilegious approach to learning
music, I was never exposed to a “note dictionary” if you will. Most
people learn to read sheet music, and so when they read an E, they play
an E, and know that they are playing an E. To people with long pitch
memories, the sound of an E and the name of an E will become synonymous
- and this is how they develop the ability known as perfect pitch. They
learn to associate the note <em>label</em> (ie E, F, G#) with the sound
of the frequency of that note because they are exposed to the name and
the sound simultaneously.</p>
<p>If, however, you learned like me, then you were only exposed to the
sound of the note, never its name. Fair enough, I knew a few of the note
names on recorder but I didn’t learn to <em>think</em> in them - if you
asked me to play a D I would have to <em>really</em> think about what I
needed to do in order to get one. Instead, (albeit unbeknownst to me) I
started to use my pitch memory to associate the different finger
positions on recorder with the frequencies. As a result, I was able to
pick up my recorder, put a song on to play along to, and instantly know
which finger positions to use to get the right notes. I never knew that
3 and 2 fingers would play an E, just that the note in the song sounded
like “that sound it makes with 3 and 2 fingers”.</p>
<p>As you can see, perfect pitch requires two ingredients. The first
(and most fundamental) is the ability to consistently remember any given
frequency for an almost infinite time period. The second is the musical
training to know what frequencies <em>to</em> remember and the names we
give to those frequencies. If you have the first (excellent pitch
memory) then you have the potential, given the right education, to learn
perfect pitch by learning the “pitch dictionary”.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-keep-failing-perfect-pitch-tests">Why do I keep failing
perfect pitch tests?</h2>
<p>The problem with the way we test for perfect pitch currently is that
it is atomic. The methodology does not split the ability to remember
pitches infinitely (the innate bit) from the ability to remember note
names (the learned bit). This is fine for most people with perfect pitch
- if you’ve been musically educated from childhood, both of these are
second nature to you - but if you only have the innate pitch memory and
have not been exposed to musical education for long enough to have
developed a “pitch dictionary”, you will fail any perfect pitch test
instantly.</p>
<p>On a similar note (sorry!), if you use a standard for labelling
pitches other than the 12-tone system we use in the West, then most
perfect pitch tests will fail you too. This one is more solvable - all
that would be required would be setting up a different array of
frequencies and labels on the test, but it proves that the pitch
dictionary is learned, and not innate as your pitch dictionary is
relative to your chosen pitch system. (On a side note, a pitch
dictionary doesn’t just contain note names either - I’ve got the ability
to know whether any given helicopter going over the house is the police
helicopter or not because it has a distinct pitch entry in my
dictionary)</p>
<p>Anyway - tests. When I first discovered I had perfect pitch I was
worried by the fact that the excellent test I found on <a
href="https://tonedear.com/ear-training/absolute-perfect-pitch-test">this
site</a> always failed me, even on easy mode, because I had not yet
learned the “pitch dictionary”. I can now score 100% even on the “all
notes” mode after a bit of training - so don’t worry if you think you
might not have perfect pitch because one of these sites tells you you
don’t. There is a chance that you have the innate bit (pitch memory)
which is needed to be able to develop perfect pitch, and with a bit of
learning of the pitch dictionary, you will be able to develop perfect
pitch.</p>
<p>If, however, you don’t have the pitch memory ability, then sadly it
is unlikely you will be able to develop perfect pitch in any meaningful
capacity. People have done DIY experiments trying to, and some people
get to a working level with a lot of practice, but I think that just
shows they have a slightly better pitch memory than most. Pitch memory
is likely a spectrum. People with infinite pitch memory sit at one end,
tone-deaf people at the other. You can fall anywhere in between those
two rare extremes; most people fall somewhere just below the middle from
my experience.</p>
<p>Don’t be disheartened by this - even saying this as somebody who
possesses this rare ability, it’s far from everything it is cracked up
to be. It doesn’t make you a musical genius; it doesn’t really serve as
anything more than a party trick and the ability to save a few quid on a
guitar tuner! In fact, I wonder if had I not had the ability to “play by
ear” as I called it back when I was being taught music, might have I put
in more effort to learning sheet music and classical training at school?
Perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-what-you-have">Knowing what you have</h2>
<p>Now that we have a good fundamental understanding as to what perfect
pitch is, and had a look at how it is believed to work (although there
are so few studies substantiating this evidence that these beliefs
should be taken with an ocean’s worth of salt) is there perhaps a way to
test for just pitch memory for those who do not have musical training?
I’d suggest there is:</p>
<p>Begin by taking a song which you haven’t listened to for a while (at
least a day). Make sure you know it well enough (if you know the lyrics
by rote, you probably know it well enough). <strong>WITHOUT LISTENING TO
THE SONG AT ALL</strong> use the voicenotes feature on your phone to
record yourself singing the first verse or the chorus - any section of
the song will do. Stop the recording, then go and listen to the studio
version of that song. Skip to the section which you have just recorded
yourself singing. Check to see if your pitch memory was correct - play
the section of the song and the recording you made, and see if they
sound like they are in the same key. If they are, try it a few more
times with a few more songs - the chances are if you can do this
consistently, you have a long or infinite pitch memory. Don’t worry if
you get one or two wrong, I find that songs I am less familiar with or
which I haven’t listened to in a few weeks can start to slip out of tune
(although if you have developed perfect pitch you can cheat by
remembering the name of the first note of the song, then using that as
your starting point.)</p>
<p>Conversely, something that can clue you into this is if you get
annoyed by out of tune material - I am currently watching Young Sheldon,
and I knew instantly upon starting Season 7 that the theme tune sounded
a lot lower than it should have been (they re-recorded it in a lower
key). Similarly, about 10 years ago people on YouTube used to pitch
music up or down slightly to avoid copyright claims. I was always able
to hear this instantly, and it annoyed me immensely, but it seemed to
bother no one else. That is likely because relative pitch (which others
were using to interpret the song) doesn’t care about the starting note,
only how it relates to the notes which follow it. Given that the entire
song had been transposed up or down, the relationship between the notes
remained unchanged, so most people never actually noticed unless they
listened to the original immediately before or after. If any of this
sounds familiar to you, you probably have an above-average pitch memory
and might be able to learn perfect pitch to some degree! All you can
really do is give it a go.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This guide outlined that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good pitch <em>memory</em> is the ability to remember specific
frequencies in-tune for long or infinite periods of time and it
something you are probably born with.</li>
<li>If you use your pitch memory to remember the names and sounds of the
12 notes of the octave, you have <em>perfect pitch</em>.</li>
<li>It is possible to have good pitch memory without having perfect
pitch - but if you have good pitch memory, perfect pitch can be learned
by remembering the 12 notes of the octave.</li>
<li>If you don’t have good pitch memory, you probably can’t learn
perfect pitch.</li>
<li>Online perfect pitch tests don’t test for pitch memory, and can lead
you to believe that you don’t have perfect pitch when indeed you
might.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that this guide manages to help you understand the terms and
concepts associated with perfect pitch. If you have it, enjoy it - see
what creative uses you can come up with for it! If you don’t, don’t
worry. Relative pitch is far more impressive, because you have to work
hard at developing it - you aren’t just born with it! <a

a good place to start learning relative pitch if you’re
interested.</a></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This article is based on my own
experience. I tried not to make any absolute claims of certainty, and
you should note that scientific research is incredibly sparse on the
topic because of how difficult it is <em>to</em> research (we’ve already
discussed how flawed the methodologies are), and how small the pool of
people with perfect pitch is. Your experience may differ from mine.</p>
