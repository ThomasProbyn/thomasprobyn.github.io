<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">Justifying JavaScript: Politeness on
the Web</h1>
<p class="date">23rd September 2024 / Updated 25th August 2025</p>
</header>
<p>There are a few things which I block on the web. Javascript, cookies
and adverts are the main ones, as well as redirecting some particularly
addictive web services to about:blank/less addictive services to stop me
using them altogether. But Javascript (and cookies) seem to cause a bit
of a problem. Many sites don’t seem to like you blocking them.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-block-javascript">But why block JavaScript?</h2>
<p>I am aware of the risk of this article becoming a philosophical
debate along the lines of “well really, you shouldn’t <em>be</em>
blocking JavaScript, it’s considered a core part of how websites work.
Mind, I frankly can’t see any way of explaining this predicament without
an explanation of the relatively complex considerations that went into
doing so. And so:</p>
<p>My typical rebuttal is thus: “I shouldn’t <em>need</em> to block
JavaScript, I only do because it’s not used for its defined purpose as a
core web technology”. Well - I suppose in a very fast and loose sense,
it sort of still is, but there is nuance here. Javascript exists as a
programming language which is mostly fully featured and can be made to
do anything (effectively) to web pages within a browser. If you use the
legal principle of spirit rather than letter, then JavaScript was
intended as a way to make things happen on a webpage. It is the
puppetmaster to your HTML and CSS, it manipulates them in real-time. It
was never really intended as a way to write full desktop
applications.</p>
<p>And so, why do we have the situation we have now - yet another week,
yet another 15 web applications added to the ever expanding internet?
Well, if you interpret by the letter, then <em>technically</em> the
JavaScript standard has just enough power in it to enable you to write a
good desktop application with a very easy to write frontend and
relatively standard backend. Throw in for free the almost total
platform-agnosticism and it’s rather obvious why we are in the current
situation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is what spoils JavaScript for me - the fact that
people don’t use the right tool for the job any more. Instead of using
JavaScript as intended, to make little scripts (a few hundred kilobytes
at most in size), many sites now insist on loading tens of megabytes of
JavaScript frameworks, the majority of whom’s features are left entirely
untouched for the duration of runtime. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">Minification</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">GZipping</a> are really
just workarounds which highlight the problem, rather than addressing the
root cause of it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are the obvious tracking issues too: combined with
cookies, JavaScript can be used to track you across many different
websites, and allow a profile to be built from your browsing activities.
Whilst not impossible, it is significantly more difficult to track
effectively static HTML requests, and so most websites simply won’t
bother.</p>
<h2 id="courtesy-and-politeness">Courtesy and politeness</h2>
<p>My reasons for not using JavaScript are not the main focus of this
article - the reactions of those who disagree with me are. By “those”, I
am in fact not referring to humans, but websites, and the humans who
designed those websites. On the majority of web apps, NoScript users are
often treated with (if they’re lucky) an infinite spinning circle which
will never disappear. It has no way of disappearing! I’d in fact be
willing to bet that the developers of most of these sites never even
bothered to check what happened when you tried to load them with no
script, as there seems to be a conception that users with NoScript
enabled don’t want to view the app anyway.</p>
<p>If web apps are inevitable (as so they would seem) and people aren’t
going to write a desktop app even when they really should, then can’t we
at least have some sort of a standard for addressing noscript users,
instead of the poor loading experience or blank white pages we are
treated to now?</p>
<p>Given that one of the most brilliant things about JavaScript is its
complete control over the DOM (the programmatic representation of all
the things you see on the screen), why are sites not more noscript
friendly? The solution is pretty simple to me. Many websites load a
blank HTML file, then use DOM construction methods to build the page
using your device (rather than sending a pre-built HTML page). Why a
blank page? If your plan is to use DOM construction methods once
JavaScript is available, then why not write a few more lines to
deconstruct an existing DOM?</p>
<p>If, instead of a blank page, users were served something more along
the lines of:</p>
<p><strong><code>JavaScript Required</code></strong></p>
<p><code>This is a web app, and can't run without using JavaScript. Your browser either doesn't support JavaScript or it has been disabled. Please either use a browser which supports JavaScript, or reference your browser's manual for instructions of how to enable it</code></p>
<p>then the first line of the JavaScript for the app could remove that,
as those users would not need to see it. This is precisely what I did
with the <a
href="https://tomprobyn.uk/blogs/projects/ratio_clock/app">simplified
ratio clock</a>. There is no (reasonable) way in which that could work
without JavaScript, but instead of showing those users who don’t use
JavaScript a completely blank page, I give them a short-but-to-the-point
error message:</p>
<p><code>If you cannot see the clock here, enable JavaScript and try again.</code></p>
<p>I didn’t feel it necessary to give the users detailed instructions as
the sort of people using this site generally don’t need them. They’re
the sort of people who are already all-to-used to seeing infinitely
spinning wheels, and questioning whatever ungodly force it was that ever
lead them to disable JavaScript.</p>
<p><em>Update 25/Aug/2025: I’ve since discovered the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements/noscript">NoScript</a> tag.
This tag does the thing I am describing here automatically and
semantically! Quite <strong>how</strong> I’ve never discovered this
despite feeling quite so passionate about this issue I don’t know. But
the point still stands - far too few websites use this tag and everybody
employing JavaScript should be bound to provide an alternative, no
excuses.</em></p>
<p>This isn’t a new idea either - many websites do already do this which
is fantastic. Google Maps even had a little easter egg hidden in the
NoScript page! What I am slightly annoyed about is the prevalence of
websites which <em>don’t</em> adhere to this sort of thing. It’s
something you only really notice when you do feel the need to disable
JavaScript and have a poke around the web. What I think should happen is
more sites should have an obligation to their users to serve them the
information they want, regardless of the format they choose to view it
on. A standard of sorts could be helpful, and so:</p>
<h2 id="the-proposal">The proposal</h2>
<p>Here it is then, my take on the matter. This is what I think should
happen if a site absolutely needs JavaScript.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Do you actually <em>need</em> JavaScript? Why do you need it? Is
it to do something that specifically requires JavaScript, or could you
do it using forms, links, images, etc? It might be less fancy but it’ll
be far more standardised and longevous</p></li>
<li><p>Build only the JavaScript you need. Don’t dump an enormous
JavaScript library full of functions you don’t need onto your users.
They will appreciate the speed and increased compatibility; you will
enjoy far lower bandwidth costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider noscript users. Understand who they are and why they
disable scripts - there are more reasons than just tracking
avoidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask yourself why you want your users to unblock JavaScript? Is it
just to make the site prettier? Would it still mostly work without it?
If it isn’t strictly necessary, then don’t ask users to unblock it, just
build your site in a more robust way.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully consider <em>how</em> you ask your users to unblock
JavaScript, and remember that this is your last resort. Remember that
you are asking a favour of your user, and they don’t have to do this.
They are more than welcome to go and find somebody else doing exactly
what you do without using JavaScript.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a default message which will be shown to all users without
JavaScript enabled. Give them reasons for being asked to unblock
JavaScript, not just “Please unblock JavaScript” or “This site works
better with JavaScript”. Tell them <em>specifically</em> what will break
and justify why you can’t just use HTML to do it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think if many websites implemented these steps (or something less
biased and opinionistic, founded on actual user research, but similar to
these steps) then the web would be far better for Noscript users. No
longer would we be excluded from websites which should really just be
collections of <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
elements, and websites which really needed JavaScript would only use it
for the things it was <em>absolutely</em> necessary for. Unfortunately,
that isn’t going to happen, but it’s a nice thought, isn’t it?</p>
