<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In response to a brief for a Computer Science class on filtering
algorithms, I built an algorithm capable of accurately solving a certain
highly popular (and <a
href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/wordle-and-ip-law-what-happens-when-a-hot-game-gets-cloned/">trademarked
- though not entirely original</a>) word <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">game</a>. The
algorithm was implemented in Python3 over a few days, and works almost
flawlessly. The answers it produces almost always complete the puzzle
within the requisite 6 tries; the one time this failed to be the case
was down to human error.</p>
<p>And indeed it is that human error issue which led to the selection of
this project for re-design. Whilst the algorithm performed perfectly,
the user needed to enter commands in an essoteric text-based format in
order to actually <em>access</em> the algorithm.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A typical example of the old text-based
rules system which was used to define the positions and values of
letters in the word.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>The text-based system caused two chief problems: the user had to
learn and remember all of the operators and syntax required to add a
rule into the list; and the inconsistent syntax of the system made it
unclear what parameters a particular operator could take (ie. some
operators could take both a position argument <em>and</em> a value
argument).</p>
<p>The algorithm, whilst efficient, was also built a few years ago and
was not reflective of my ability to write high-quality code. A complete
refactoring would be required in order to try and separate the core
algorithm from the shibboleths of operating-system specific knotting and
bodges.</p>
<p>This, though, would provide the perfect opportunity to translate the
algorithm into JavaScript for re-implementation. I planned to use core
web technologies in order to implement the algorithm online such that it
might make it more accessible, especially in a cross-platform
context.</p>
<h2 id="code-re-implementation">Code Re-implementation</h2>
<p>The process of re-implementation started by looking at the original
high-level abstracted algorithm design, marginally edited here to remove
aforementioned anachronisms:</p>
<pre><code>Import word list from file
Objectify word list; make it indexable
Import rules; objectify and make them indexable

For each rule:
    Check rule type
    For each word in the list:
        If the word DOES NOT match the rule, delete it from the list

Output the word list</code></pre>
<p>This is the basic structure for the main loop of the programme, not
including the filtering systems. In order to translate this into
JavaScript, I chose to use JavaScript-specific object formats in order
to store data. This would eliminate the non-exact representation system
for rules which had been used in the original Python algorithm, and
allow the algorithm to hold an internal representation of the data which
could be set via an API.</p>
<p>This is a significantly better system than the python implementation,
which required the users to attempt to understand the internal
organisation of the algorithm in order to use it. This semantically
separates the data from the way in which it is processed, which is
significantly better programming practice.</p>
<h3 id="object-structure">Object Structure</h3>
<p>When defining the object structure itself, an array containing many
sub-objects made the most sense, as throughout the process, rule
creation is dynamic, with limits defined purely by the machine’s memory
capacity. Each sub-object could be given a heritable structure from a
template super-object, meaning the API could insert a new object by
simply cloning the super-object into a free memory slot, then populating
it with the arguements passed to the command.</p>
<p>The super-object holds three parameters, some of which are not needed
for certain rules, but which could in these cases default to holding a
null value. These paramerters are: <code>Type (string)</code> - the type
of rule being held in this slot and determining which type of filtering
should be used, <code>value (character)</code> - generally defining the
particular letter to filter for, and finally,
<code>position [optional](integer)</code> - defining where in the word a
particular value occured. These three parameters, when used together can
adaquately describe any concievable Word Game™ play state.</p>
<h3 id="initial-user-interface">Initial User Interface</h3>
<p>Once these elements were assembled, the algorithm could accurately
represent the current state of play, as well as process using the
filters, initial tests in the JavaScript showed the output to be
identical to the Python implementation on a given ruleset, meaning the
code translation had likely been successful pending further examination.
In order to make testing easier, I put together a small user interface
which, though far from final, could allow a user to input rules
graphically:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/work/firstVersion.jpg"
alt="The initial user interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The initial user interface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The interface provoked some thoughts about general structure and
navigation which went on to shape the next iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ruleset, whilst displayed here, is not necessary to use the
software successfully</li>
<li>The word list could be confusing, as well as what the user is meant
to do with it</li>
<li>Rule types need to be given names outside of their programmatic
entities (“doesNotContain”)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="second-ui-iteration-improving-experience-and-navigation">Second
UI Iteration: Improving experience and navigation</h2>
<p>The second UI iteration was designed initially on paper:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/work/split-screen-paper.jpeg"
alt="An iconic representation of using a split-screen UI" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An iconic representation of using a
split-screen UI</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The idea was to use a split-screen system, with the left panel
displaying a list of the rule set, and the right panel displaying the
potential words which could be used to solve the game. Instead of using
algorithm-specific terminology to describe the rule name, more
user-freindly options are now used, describing what each option
means:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/work/user-friendly-options.jpg"
alt="A dropdown list with more user-friendly descriptions of rulesets" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A dropdown list with more user-friendly
descriptions of rulesets</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This version now has a particular flow to it. The user adds a rule by
starting at the top, the rule then moves over to the left panel, and
updates the right panel with the final output. It follows the
input-process-output mantra from computing.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/work/graphics.jpg"
alt="A slightly better UI using a split-screen system" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A slightly better UI using a split-screen
system</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After an analysis of this design, I came away with a few extra
pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split-screen UIs do not work well at all on mobile; changing to a
different system depending on screen size would introduce
inconsistency</li>
<li>Drop-down boxes for selecting multi-option toggleable functionality
can feel like they lean towards a preference for the default, and can
hide important functionality</li>
<li>Inputting position as a number can be confusing, as it requires
counting the number of letters individually</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="third-ui-iteration-improving-top-level-design">Third UI
Iteration: Improving top-level design</h2>
<p>Improving upon the aforementioned points, and increasing the overall
usability of the system, this prototype came to be the final design:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/work/mockup.jpg"
alt="A prototype of the final design" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A prototype of the final
design</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The design is now significantly more focused. Analysis of the first
version found that showing the internal working of the rules and the
algorithms was unnecessary, and priority should be given to what it is
that users want: an answer. To this end, only a single word is
displayed.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality selection, the togglebox system exposes the
functionality previously hidden behind a drop-down menu. This also
allows all instructions to be on screen at all times, meaning that it is
clear both what the programme is doing and is not doing.</p>
<p>Parameter entry is now significantly simplified too: the “letters”
box automatically focuses as soon as a rule has been selected, allowing
easy keyboard navigation. For entering the position of a letter, a
checkbox system graphically represents the letter position as it would
be represented in Word Game™. This makes entry significantly less
confusing.</p>
<p>The addition of a certainty bar is not something which the algorithm
currently accomodates, but which could help users get an idea of how
close they are to an answer, perhaps more crucial in latter game stages
than earlier, but still likely of use. The percentage is calculated
using a bit of mathematical trickery to scale percentages at different
non-linear gradients, relative to the degree of certainty. For instance,
if out of the 70,000 words the programme knows about, it has eliminated
all but 30, the mathematical certainty would display 99.9%. However, 30
words when only 6 may be played in total is still a long was off in real
terms, so the scaling adapts that to closer to 90% certainty. That is to
say, the displayed percentage is not mathematically accurate at all, but
the incrementation <strong><em>feels</em></strong> significantly more
accurate perceptively when using the system.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the outcome of the final version of this project,
and I feel that it has demonstrated my improved programming and
interface design skills since the algorithm’s inception. There are some
functions which I feel are still missing, such as the ability to edit
the rules which the algorithm is using to filter words, or the number of
letters in the word, but these would be outside of the scope of this
project which set out to improve the usability of the filtering
algorithm.</p>
