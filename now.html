<p class="date">Last Updated: 2nd May 2025</p>

<h2 id="main-things">Main things</h2>
<p>As of yesterday, I have finished my undergraduate course (<a
href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc
UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier
University</a>)! It’s not hit me properly yet I don’t think, so I’m
waiting until that happens, and then I’ll start moving on to the next
stage. Read next month’s Now Page if you want to hear more when that
happens.</p>
<h2 id="radio">Radio</h2>
<p>I’m still very active on the air, trying to get at least 1 contact a
day. That’s making me a much better amateur operator, and more confident
on the air. I’m on 2m and 70cms almost exclusively now, but occasionally
have the Meshtastic on too.</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>I wrote my first <a href="./blogs/restalrig_history.html">blog</a> in
a long time last Wednesday. Having finished the honours project, I hope
I’ll be able to get out, and have some words left in me when I get back
too. I’ve written <em>far</em> too much about library systems in the
past month! I also don’t think I mentioned, but the bug I referred to in
<a href="./blogs/static_site_generator_lessons.html">this blog</a>
(where the site would take about 1.1x longer to build with every added
page) was getting to me, so a few weeks ago, I decided to hunt it down
and squash it. As I had surmised in that blog, I had got a loop wrong.
In fact, a single wrongly-indented line of Python was enough to do it,
and now that’s all fixed, the site builds in less than 3 seconds! A
marked improvement.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I picked up a copy of a book in the local charity bookshop about
Pugin, an architect whose work I have admired from a distance for a
while, but about whom I know relatively little. It’s called <a
href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/587603728">God’s architect:
Pugin and the building of romantic Britain</a> if you’re interested.</p>
<h2 id="a-note">A note</h2>
<p>As I have said, I am a little out-written at the moment (in the past
three days I have typed roughly 18,000 words), so I apologise for the
shorter-than usual Now Page, but hope it brings you some happiness
anyway.</p>
