<h2 id="main-things">Main things</h2>
<p>I’m currently in Edinburgh, studying <a
href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc
UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier
University</a>, where I’m in my third and final year. I’m completing my
honours project, where I’m building a home-usable library management
system specifically aimed at old books which don’t have ISBN data. It’s
going very well and I’m getting a bit lost in research and enjoying it
very much. Not long to go now until it’s over though! After that I’ll be
on the hunt for a job.</p>
<h2 id="radio">Radio</h2>
<p>I’ve been really enjoying amateur recently. I’ve been very active on
2m and 70cm in Edinburgh, and I’m having a lot of fun talking to people
in the local area. I’m researching SOTA at the moment, and looking to
try and do my first summit very soon (after already having climbed up a
SOTA summit with my radio sort of unknowingly!). I’ve taken the time to
finally set up my page on <a
href="https://www.qrz.com/db/M7XXI">qrz.com</a> for people looking me up
on there, and using a little trick you can do, you should be able to use
both my Scottish (M<strong>M</strong>7XXI) and English (M7XXI) callsigns
to look me up as I pretty regularly use both. I often hang around on
GB3ED for anyone near Edinburgh!</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Mostly stuff related to honours at the moment, so that is
documentation for the various programming languages I’m using, and
literature related to the history and operation of libraries, and
libraries within the home. My current book which I’m getting through at
about a word a week at the moment is “The English Cathedrals” (Pelton
and Harvey, 1950), a very interesting look at the social and
architectural history of the seats of ecclesiastical power in
England.</p>
