<h2 id="lifeworkeducation">Life/work/education</h2>
<p>Wow! I’ve not done a now page for a good long time now. June was the
last one, and even that was late. And in truth, there’s been a lot gone
on since then.</p>
<p>Back in June, I was feeling a bit lost with the myriad options I had
after leaving university. I considered the option of further study -
briefly - I simply didn’t feel excited by it. Compounding that, the
state of UK universities now didn’t really give me all that much
confidence. I definitely didn’t want to work in UX, I felt hugely
disillusioned with it after doing the degree, and the industry seemed to
be taking a nosedive. It felt like it was becoming less and less about
creating solid products that can last a lifetime and more about
engineering things to break, cause frustrations, and extract money from
people in the most efficient manor. Not something I could feel OK
doing.</p>
<p>And so I looked to different industries and tried researching what it
took to get into them. I tried for a few entry level jobs and didn’t get
far. I am of course though highly interested in music, audio technology
and the like. So when an apprenticeship at a local theatre came up, I
applied for that very quickly!</p>
<p>I didn’t end up getting the apprenticeship, but what happened next
was what I’d describe as a blessing in disguise: I was recommended a
free “bootcamp” course at the local college. After a bit of
deliberation, I decided there was no harm in trying, so I signed up for
it. After having nearly finished, I feel like I know how to navigate
getting work in live sound a bit better now, which previously was an
absolute mystery to me.</p>
<p>Whilst I’m still not out of the woods on the “getting a job” front, I
feel very relieved to have found something which genuinely excites me,
allows me to live, and most of all, doesn’t require particularly
flexible morals.</p>
<p>I did my first shadowing session a few days ago at a local venue, and
I’ve got an induction at another venue on Saturday, so I’m very much
starting to get involved with things I feel. This is definitely a
difficult thing for autistic people to navigate I’m finding, sending
emails is horrendous, but its getting easier, and I’m finding that what
I get out of doing so is well worth the sheer terror of awaiting a
reply!</p>
<h2 id="radio">Radio</h2>
<h3 id="digitalmesh">Digital/Mesh</h3>
<p>Lots of radio things going on at the moment! I’m running a permenant
meshtastic node in Newcastle now, which will soon be switched to a
repeater as I’ve got a M7XXI/M node on the way too, due to be delivered
today in fact! I’ve got quite a few nodes picked up and there seems to
be almost daily activity which is fun to take part in.</p>
<p>I’ve found even cheaper mesh nodes available than the Heltec ones, so
I may potentially try a few of those, and that would also allow me to
simultaneously experiment with MeshCore, which appears to me to be a
technically <em>and</em> socially better standard than Meshtastic. But I
am currently very much enjoying help crowd out the 34cm band in any way
I can!!</p>
<h2 id="analogue-voice">Analogue Voice</h2>
<p>I’ve not been on as much as I’d have liked to have been recently.
I’ve been joining into a few nets where I’ve been free, but I’ve been so
busy recently that most evenings I’m either out doing something or in
bed by 8pm! But I am still very much active on 2m/70cms.</p>
