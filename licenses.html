<h2 id="artificial-intelligence">“Artificial” “Intelligence”</h2>
<p>I have a strong personal <del>hatred</del> dislike for
<abbr title="If the outputs of LLMs and the like are purely the product of their inputs, then I think there's a pretty interesting philosophical debate there about whether it can truly be considered artificial. But that debate is for someone far more qualified than me to have.">“articifical”</abbr>
<abbr title="Well, given my stance on the topic, you can probably see my objection here. But also, from a more technical standpoint, this is not true intelligence, it is really just very complex probability. Models do not truly - and yes, I'm counting semantic models here too - understand the relationships between data, merely can they represent it and parametrically understand that relationship in terms of the number of connections, strength of connections, etc. All of this can simulate intelligence, but I don't think it is actually intelligence as we think of it in human terms. CITATION NEEDED!!!">“intelligence”</abbr>,
especially large language models. In a sentence, I think the simplest
way of justifying this is that their output is utterly mediocre as
compared the amount of input resources they require - both data and
energy. The balance just doesn’t add up. And to boot, we already
<em>have</em> a tool which can run on minimal energy and data, and whose
output has been proven to change the world countless times - the human
brain.</p>
<p>Please know that I am personally loathed to anybody using this site
or the data thereon for model training, and I would consider anybody
doing so after reading this passage to be extremely disrespectful.
Explicitly, you may not use this site or the data thereon for any
purpose involving model training or testing.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, if you are a <em>human</em> who wishes to
quote or re-use part of this site for whatever activity (with proper
attribution of course!), then you have my blessing and I’d love it if
you’d <a href="/contact">share</a> what you’re doing with me!</p>
<h3 id="sharealike-and-proper-attribution">ShareAlike and Proper
Attribution</h3>
<p>One of the protections offered by CC-BY-SA 4.0 is ShareAlike (which
is what the SA stands for). This means that if you take some of my work,
transform it, and re-publish it, you <strong>must</strong> publish your
work under the same, CC-BY-SA 4.0, license. You must also indicate that
changes were made (by using terms such as “based on” or “transformation
of” in your attribution). More details on ShareAlike are <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use">here</a>,
and on indicating that you have made changes <a
href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Modifications_and_adaptations_must_be_marked_as_such">here</a>.</p>
<p>The other important condition is Proper Attribution, which is a
specific term defining exactly what a citation should say in a specific
circumstance; it does not simply constitute linking to a resource you
have used. To give Proper Attribution, you can use <a
href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chart">this
table</a> as a guide for what to include in your citation. Considering
this information, the below would be an appropriate citation which you
might use if you were to copy part of <a
